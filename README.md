# The Chinese Cookbook Constellation

## Project Overview
The Chinese Cookbook Constellation is a digital humanities project that visualizes and analyzes the transformation of Chinese recipes over a century. Using Shiu Wong Chan's 1917 cookbook *The Chinese Cook Book* as a historical baseline, this project maps how recipes have been adapted, modified, and reinterpreted by five influential modern chefs and food bloggers.

The project employs network analysis to model recipe evolution, treating recipes as nodes and culinary modifications as edges. By visualizing these relationships, it seeks to reveal patterns of cultural transmission, ingredient substitution, and culinary adaptation across the Chinese diaspora.
